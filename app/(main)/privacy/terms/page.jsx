        <p>
          Suppose any provision of these terms is held to be unenforceable or

          possible under applicable law, and the remaining provisions will

          Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
          require the performance of an obligation under these terms shall not
          affect a party&apos;s ability to exercise such right or require such
          performance at any time after that, nor shall the waiver of a breach
          constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
