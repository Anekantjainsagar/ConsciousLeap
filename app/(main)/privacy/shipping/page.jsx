          Thank you for visiting and shopping at Conscious Store. Following are

        <p className="underline font-bold mt-2">STANDARD SHIPPING POLICY</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-1">
          <li>
            We currently deliver across India to all metros and certain
            non-metro cities.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have tied up with a reliable logistics partner that ensures
            reliable delivery of non-perishable items across cities. For
            perishable goods, we have a dedicated logistics team that will pick
            up your products from the vendor and hand-deliver it to you (This
            service is currently available only in select cities for select
            products).
          </li>
          <li>
            We try our very best to ensure that there are no delays in
            shipments, but sometimes it&apos;s beyond our control.

        <p className="underline font-bold mt-2">SHIPPING TIME</p>
        <ul className="list-disc ml-5 mt-1">
          <li>
            Since most of the products are made to order, we allow the vendors
            to decide on the lead time they require. This time is indicated
            alongside each product and reflected on the checkout page. Typically
            the lead time is 5-7 working days.
          </li>
          <li>
            The logistics partner gets a notification once the vendor has your
            product ready for dispatch. They will then pick it up from the
            vendor and deliver it to you between 8 am to 9 pm on all business
            days between Monday to Saturday.
          </li>
          <li>
            We ship on all days (Monday to Saturday) except Sundays and public
            holidays.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you feel that the packaging of the product is tampered with or
            damaged at the time of delivery, please refuse to accept delivery of
            the product and contact us immediately at support@consciousleap.co
            mentioning your order reference number and a picture of the tampered
            package. We shall ensure a replacement delivery is made to you at
            the earliest.

              <li>
                In the unfortunate scenario that your shipment has been
                misplaced or lost en route, we can either resend the order to
                you (if the same products are still in stock), issue a credit
                note to you, or reimburse the amount completely to you. In such
                a case, we would request you to confirm in writing to us that
                you have not received the product. However, consciousleaps
                decision in this regard shall be final and binding to you and
                you shall not be entitled to raise any claims in that regard.{" "}
