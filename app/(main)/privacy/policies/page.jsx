          from anyone under the age of 12 without verification of parental
          consent. In that case, we remove that information from our servers. If

          with Personal Data, please get in touch with us.

          If we rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your information
          and your country requires permission from a parent, We may need your
          parent&apos;s consent before we collect and use that information.
